# Feeding Susuwataris

A fun and cute twist on the classic Space Invaders game, featuring Totoro and Susuwataris from the movie "My Neighboor Totoro".

# Motivation

This was a assignment for my Web Application Development class. The goal of the project was to use **JavaScript** and the [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/) library to get more familiar with Objects and Graphics in JavaScript.

# Build status

The project is finished. Although, it could be modified to make it closer in terms of playability to the original game.
